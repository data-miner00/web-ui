_"We use cookies to make your experience on our website more personalized,"_ followed by a button that reads "Accept" or "Accept All" just to name a few. 

Unless you've been living under the rock, you would have aware about the existence of the "cookies" as they are ubiquitous when browing through the net. Some websites even put up a full-screen mask that covers the entire page and force you to accept their beseech to use cookies or else you are forbidden to use their site and it can be infuriating at times.

## Introduction

### What are cookies actually?

Cookies are information that are stored on the web browser for a website and are used to communicate with their respective web server. Those information are useful to provide authentication and personalized experience to its users.

There are several types of cookies that are being used on the internet. Session cookies, persistent cookies, authentication cookies and tracking cookies are some of the examples.

As useful as it can be, it comes with security risks that might afflict users. Cookies can be use for tracking user activities across the browser and this behaviour may be misused or even abused for malicious intents such as spying, stalking and harrassment.

Hence, numerous privacy laws such as the EU's [ePrivacy Directive](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-eprivacy-directive/) came into place that mandates the user of any cookie-reliant websites to provide an "informed consent" upon visiting their site. Thus, this is the reason that we've been seeing all these banners and prompts for cookies all this while.

### Guideline

Generally, cookies consent banner should be placed at a spot that is easily noticeable by the user, but with an unobtrusive manner. In my opinion, it's the best to place at the corners of the website, typically on the bottom left or bottom right side. If it is a banner representation, place it before the header or fix it at the bottom of the page.

### Showcase

Here are a few examples of the Cookies component found online. The first one is by [Elliptic](https://elliptic.co). It is quite generic as the cookies statement only have a paragraph of declarations and buttons to accept or decline the offer. In this case, the users are provided with the options to decline the cookies, while there are websites that doen't even provide that option at all.

This is how it looks like in the full website.

Besides, there are cookies that has the _"manage"_ option so that user can customize what services are needed and accept accordingly. Below is the cookies card found on [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co).

One can be more creative when it comes to something so common like this to make the website more fun and engaging. [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) have made their cookies card with an old-school, console-like theme that make it stands out from the crowd.

Jetbrains put the cookies card on the bottom right of their site.

[Gather Town](https://www.gather.town/) uses cartoons of their theme within its cookies card and this is brilliant as the mundane process of dealing with the cookies are more lively and pleasant for end users. The dog being fed with cookie is really cute in my opinion.
