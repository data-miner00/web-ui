Navigation bar is the most **crucial** component of the modern web. Without navigation bar, user may have a hard time navigating in and out of the website as there is no road signs that points to the destination while user aimlessly browsing around.

## Variants

### Header

Header can be seen in _almost all_ of the websites exist, like there is no sane website that doesn't include a header in their website at all. They are commonly seen in the read-only website such as **news**, **corporate portfolios**, **documentations** and **web app landing page** just to name a few.

Here are the examples on what header looks like for [Kusama](https://kusama.network) and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology),

<v-img folder="collections/navbar" image="polygon_nav.png" widthClass="w-full"></v-img>

It all usually starts with the logo on the left, then followed by links and call to action button.

However, it is completely acceptable to place the logo in the center of the header too. [The New York Times](https://nytimes.com) places its logo in middle and it shows the dignity of the website very well.

### Sidebar

Sidebar is another variant of navigation bar. It is usually seen in web applications in the form of dashboard. We'll be taking a look on the basic version of sidebar over here. Refer to [here](/collections/subscription) for more sophisticated breakdown.

It is common to see web application utilizing the sidebar to group their functionalities and navigate users through different features available. However, sidebar can be used for non-web apps and that is totally fine too.

Here is how the sidebar looks like. The examples are taken from [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/), [Cimb Bank](https://www.cimbclicks.com.my/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Infura](https://infura.io/) respectively.

### Footer

When it comes to footer, it is pretty common to use it as the secondary form of navigation where links such as privacy policy, cookies and corporate links are included for more information to be conveyed.

The contents that can be found here are mostly navigation links, copyright claims, social media links and newsletter subscriptions.

The design of footer can be very simple, but it also can be very complex. Here we will be covering some of the more basic version instead.

I am quite pleased to see such magnificent footer by [Insider](https://www.insider.com/asia) that is encompassing all the important info in such a neat and tidy way.
